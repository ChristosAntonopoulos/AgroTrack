# Olive Lifecycle Platform - Root Coding Standards

## General Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Keep components/functions small and focused
- Comment complex business logic; avoid obvious comments
- Security-first approach: validate all inputs, never commit secrets

## Git Workflow
- Feature branches: `feature/module-name`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/issue-description`
- Commit messages: Clear, present tense (e.g., "Add field lifecycle validation")
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`

## Documentation
- README per module with setup instructions
- Inline comments for business logic
- API documentation (Swagger for backend)
- Configuration documentation

## Security
- Never commit secrets (use environment variables)
- Validate all inputs server-side
- Use HTTPS for API communication
- Sanitize user data in forms
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Project Structure
- Backend: Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Frontend: Component-driven development
- Mobile: Offline-first architecture

## Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Provide .env.example files
- Never hardcode connection strings or API keys

## Code Quality
- Consistent naming conventions per platform
- Proper error handling
- Logging for important operations
- Performance optimization where needed
